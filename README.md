# Adapting the Project on your own Local Machines


First go to the [Git Hub Repo Link](https://github.com/Mikhail-Kashin/Team-Phobos-TipsyStack) and fork it to your own repository.

After than lunch your terminal/ubuntu and go the project directory  `cd Team-Phobos-TipsyStack` .

You after going to project directory you can do a `npm install` to get the dependencies for this project or you can lunch vscode from the terminal while being on the directory by using command `code .` in the terminal. Then open the terminal from the vs code while on the main directory and you can use `npm install` to get the dependencies.

On the main directory create a file called `.env` here you can do to file called `.env.example` and copy all the contents in that file and copy in your `.env`file that you just created. 

After that go to your terminal and utilize command `psql` to lunch your Psql and create a user name `tipsy_stack_app` with password `password` and have "createdb" privilege. 

Enter command in your psql.

    CREATE USER tipsy_stack_app WITH PASSWORD "password" CREATEDB;

After create of the user entering the command enter the following commands via terminal:

    npx dotenv sequelize db:create
  Then we need to migrate database...

    npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate

After that we can seed the tables with the test cases and initial entry values.

    npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:all

If successful and error free then your database for the project should be set up. Good Job!

You can now just put in the command in your terminal `npm start` to launch nodemon leave that running in the vs-code minimize vs-code and go to your browser and type in `localhost:8080` to be able to enjoy our website locally on your own machine.

1.  Go to  [https://tipsy-stack.herokuapp.com/](https://tipsy-stack.herokuapp.com/)
2.  Log in quickly with the Demo User or create a new account.
3.  Search existing Cocktail-Q or create a thread and posts of your own!

# Challenges

Being the first project on our own there has been some challenges. We welcome them with open arms because it taught us new things as well made use better developer for it

### Search bar

Challenge with apply a search bar was an alien concept we have done queries and use those syntax and commands to create search function. After debate utilize Sequelize Library to create a search function for our website 

    router.post('/',  csrfProtection,  asyncHandler(async  (req, res)  =>  {
    const  { query }  = req.body;
    const questions =  await CocktailQ.findAll({
    include: User,where: {question: {[Op.substring]  :  `%${query}%`},},
    });
    res.render('search',  {questions,csrfToken: req.csrfToken()
	    });
    
    }));
### Voting Feature

The challenge with implementing the voting feature is how to properly show the vote count via Ajax. As well making sure user can only vote one time and adapting our values for upvote and downvote is boolean.

You can check the intergration of this "many moving parts" feature with in the file below:
[voteEvents.js](https://github.com/Mikhail-Kashin/Team-Phobos-TipsyStack/blob/main/public/javascripts/voteEvents.js)
[cocktail-q.js](https://github.com/Mikhail-Kashin/Team-Phobos-TipsyStack/blob/main/routes/cocktailq.js)
[index.js](https://github.com/Mikhail-Kashin/Team-Phobos-TipsyStack/blob/main/routes/index.js)
